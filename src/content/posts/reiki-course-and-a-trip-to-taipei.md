Last week, I took the high-speed rail to Taipei to attend a Reiki course. It’s a two-day course.\
 So, before I went, I had a feeling that it was going to be exhausting because I booked a youth hostel, which meant I had to share the space with others. \
That night, a girl was snoring, and I didn’t sleep well. 

Back to the course: I learned a lot from the Reiki class. \
But I felt there were some details missing, like certain points. The teacher didn’t teach everything from the book. \
She just asked us to practice, but we practiced without purpose. I paid 14,000 NTD for the course, but the course didn’t live up to its cost.\
 I’m sure that I won’t want to visit Taipei for a while. I don’t like the fast pace; it makes me feel nervous and anxious.\
 I would walk faster because everybody does. 

Overall, I still like the course because it gave me the ability to perform Reiki on anyone remotely from anywhere.
