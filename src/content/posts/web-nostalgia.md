After updating my website today, I fell down a rabbit hole of browsing Neocities and old, archived sites from the early internet.  \
It made me incredibly nostalgic for my childhoodâ€”for those hours spent aimlessly surfing and playing simple web games.  \
There's a certain sadness in seeing how many of those sites are gone forever. \
Life just felt so much simpler back then. 

Here are some of the pages I viewed today:
1. [bentewee- A dressup game](https://www.bentewee.com/) => I can't believe this site is still alive
2. [cherubiims](https://cherubiims.neocities.org/) => The design of this site is really cool
3. [MiniRoomMaker](https://web.archive.org/web/20180908011347/http://www.miniroommaker.com:80/rooms.html)
4. [eggring](https://eggring.neocities.org/) => A cute "egg" webring site
5. [Fang's Sozai](http://163.20.166.200/pic/pic/box.htm) => My childhood memory

I once poured countless hours into scouring the web for creative assets and building my collection,
but the vast majority of it has vanished over the years.
